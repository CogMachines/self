<h1>6. How to Program in Self</h1>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>6.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Self programming environment provides facilities for writing programs, and the transporter
provides a way to save them as source files. Of all the parts of Self, the programming environment
probably has the least research ambition in it. We simply needed to concentrate the innovation in
other areas: language design, compiler technology, user interface. The Self programming environment
strives to meet the high standard set by Smalltalk’s, but with a more concrete feels. The transporter,
on the other hand, is somewhere in-between completely innovative research and dull
development. It attempts to pull off a novel feat—programming live objects instead of text—and
partially succeeds. Its novelty lies in its view of programs as collections of slots, not objects or
classes, and its extraction of the programmer&#8217;s intentions from a web of live objects.</p>
<p>On the Macintosh, Self uses option-click for a middle-mouse click, and uses command- (the apple
key) click for the right button click. So wherever the text says “left-button-click” just click with the
mouse, where it says “middle-button click” hold down the option key and click with the mouse,
and where it says “right button click” hold down the command key and click with the mouse.
These mappings are defined in Self, so you can change them by editing the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whichButton:</span></code> method in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initialization</span></code>
category in traits <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ui2MacEvent</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="browsing-concepts">
<h2>6.2. Browsing Concepts</h2>
<div class="section" id="introducing-the-outliner">
<h3>6.2.1. Introducing the Outliner</h3>
<p>Objects in the Self environment are represented as <em>outliners</em>, which can expand to show increasing
levels of detail. One of these objects has been designed to provide a convenient context
for typed-in commands, and so it is called the shell. If the shell is not already present on your
screen, you can summon it by pressing the middle mouse button on the background and selecting
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shell</span></code>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image1.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image1.png" style="width: 174.4px; height: 60.8px;" />
</div>
<p>Outliners sport three small buttons in the top-right-hand corner labeled “/\”, “E”,
and “X”. These buttons summon the object’s parents, add an evaluator text region to the bottom of
the outliner, and dismiss the outliner. Press the “E” button to get an evaluator.</p>
<p>Type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">anExampleObject</span></code> into the evaluator (it will already be selected) and hit the <em>Get it</em> button
(or type metareturn on UNIX, or command-return on MacOS X):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image2.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image2.png" style="width: 273.6px; height: 164.0px;" />
</div>
<p>The result object appears in your “hand” raised above the screen as if you were dragging it with the
left button.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If this returns an error, it may be that you don&#8217;t have <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">anExampleObject</span></code> in your Self world. You can always load it from the file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">objects/misc/programmingExamples.self</span></code> as follows:</p>
<div class="last highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s1">&#39;path/to/objects/misc/programmingExamples.self&#39;</span> <span class="n">runScript</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Click the button to set it down.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image3.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image3.png" style="width: 280.0px; height: 56.0px;" />
</div>
<p>As with most other things on the Self screen, the left button picks it up and moves it. (For buttons
and other things that use left-button for other purposes, you can grab them with marquee selection
(really the <em>carpet morph</em> in Self) or with the “Grab” item on the right-button menu.)</p>
<div class="section" id="expand-and-collapse">
<h4>6.2.1.1. Expand and Collapse</h4>
<p>Left-click on the triangle <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1"><sup>1</sup></a> to expand the object and see more information:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image4.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image4.png" style="width: 524.8px; height: 193.6px;" />
</div>
<p>Now it shows a summary of modules containing the slots in this object (just <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">programmingExamples</span></code>
here), four slots, and a category containing more slots, although those slots are not shown
yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="categories">
<h4>6.2.1.2. Categories</h4>
<p>Clicking the top triangle now would collapse this object outliner, but instead look inside the category
by clicking its triangle:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image5.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image5.png" style="width: 520.8px; height: 286.4px;" />
</div>
<p>And, one more click expands the subcategory:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image6.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image6.png" style="width: 528.0px; height: 315.2px;" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slots">
<h4>6.2.1.3. Slots</h4>
<p>The little icons on the right edges of the slots reveal the type of slot: <img alt="methodslot" src="_images/methodslot.png" /> for a method slot (a slot
containing a method), <img alt="constantslot" src="_images/constantslot.png" /> for a constant slot (a slot containing a data object), and <img alt="assignableslot" src="_images/assignableslot.png" /> for an assignable
slot (a pair of slots containing a data object and the assignment primitive). In order to save
space, the data slot and its corresponding assignment slot are lumped together. (In other words in
addition to the visible slot named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aCategorizedVariable</span></code> containing 17, there is another, <em>invisible</em>
slot named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aCategorizedVariable</span></code>: containing the assignment primitive.)</p>
<p>To look at the object contained in a data (constant or assignable) slot, just click on its icon. But if
the slot is a method, clicking its icon opens up a text editor on its source. For example, clicking on
the icon at the right of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code> box opens a text editor displaying its source (and typing control-L
widens the object to show all the text in the selected window):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image7.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image7.png" style="width: 494.2px; height: 347.2px;" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="text-editors">
<h4>6.2.1.4. Text Editors</h4>
<p>The background of the editor is lighter than the outliner as a whole, and this difference indicates
that this editor is the current typing focus: no matter where the mouse is you can type into this editor.
A left-click on another editor will select that one as the typing focus, and to indicate that it is
no longer the focus, this editor’s background will change to match the outliner:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image8.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image8.png" style="width: 544.0px; height: 333.6px;" />
</div>
<p>The white triangle in the lower-right corner of the editor (which can barely be seen in the printout
of this document) can be dragged to resize the editor.</p>
<p>Someone has done a poor job of indenting this method, so fix it by clicking to the left of the capital–
I and deleting two spaces:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image9.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image9.png" style="width: 596.8px; height: 158.4px;" />
</div>
<p>The red and green buttons that just appeared indicate the text has been changed; it no longer reflects
the source code of the real method. Hitting the red button will cancel the changes, while hitting
the green button will accept them and change the method:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image10.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image10.png" style="width: 568.8px; height: 179.2px;" />
</div>
<p>Self text editors will honor the cursor arrow keys, the copy, paste, and cut Sun keys, and
many emacs-style control characters:</p>

<div class="section" id="dismissing-objects">
<h4>6.2.1.5. Dismissing Objects</h4>
<p>There are four separate ways of dismissing an outliner (or for that matter, anything) from the Self
desktop:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Object outliners: Push the “X” button at the top-right-hand corner.</li>
<li>Drag it to the trash: left-drag on the outliner till the mouse is over the trash can, <img alt="trashcan" class="align-middle" src="_images/trashcan.png" /> then release the mouse-button.</li>
<li>Dismiss it via the right-button menu: hold down the right button over the outliner, move to the <em>Dismiss</em> button, then release.</li>
<li>The Carpet Morph: start above (or below) and to the left (or to the right) of the outliner, over the background. Hold down the left button and sweep out an area that completely contains the outliner, then release the left button. The outliner should now be surrounded by a rectangle. Use the middle mouse button inside the rectangle to select <em>Dismiss</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two methods, dismissing from the right-button menu, and marquee selection with the carpet
morph, come in especially handy with things like buttons and menus because such morphs cannot
be grabbed with the left-button.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menus-in-the-outliner">
<h3>6.2.2. Menus in the Outliner</h3>
<p>Many other operations are available on the outliner by using the middle-button menu on the part of
the outliner to be affected. For example anExampleObject has many regions and here are some
of them:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image11.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image11.png" />
</div>
<p>Click on the desired part of the object, be it object, category, slot, text editor, or annotation (annotations
will be explained later).</p>
<div class="section" id="the-evaluator">
<h4>6.2.2.1. The Evaluator</h4>
<p>Try out the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code> method. Push the “E” button in the top-right of the outliner:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image12.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image12.png" style="width: 374.0px; height: 323.95px;" />
</div>
<p>The receiver of any messages sent from an evaluator, or indeed any text editor (via <em>Do It</em> and <em>Get It</em>
in the editor’s middle-button menu) in an object outliner is the object itself. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f2" id="id2"><sup>2</sup></a> Type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code> into
the evaluator and hit the Get it button (or select the <em>Get It</em> from the text editor menu), to send
the message and get back the result:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image13.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image13.png" style="width: 374.0px; height: 338.25px;" />
</div>
<p>Move the result <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f3" id="id3"><sup>3</sup></a> out of the way and left-click to set it down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-a-slot">
<h4>6.2.2.2. Adding a slot</h4>
<p>Try one more change: adding a slot to the category “<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">category</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">slots</span></code>.” Hold the cursor
over the words a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">slots</span></code> and select <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span> <span class="pre">Slot</span></code> from the middle-button menu.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image14.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image14.png" style="width: 544.0px; height: 449.6px;" />
</div>
<p>After selecting Add Slot a space for a new slot will appear in the object:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image15.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image15.png" style="width: 467.2px; height: 508.0px;" />
</div>
<p>Each line shows the syntax for a different kind of slot. Create a simple variable by typing
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">me&lt;-’Gumby’</span></code> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f4" id="id4"><sup>4</sup></a> and hitting the green button to accept the change:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image16.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image16.png" style="width: 466.4px; height: 506.4px;" />
</div>
<p>After releasing the green button, it stays down to let you know that it is still working. After a few
seconds the slot appears: <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f5" id="id5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image17.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image17.png" style="width: 460.0px; height: 423.2px;" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugger">
<h3>6.2.3. Debugger</h3>
<p>Explore the Self debugger. Start by scrambling the send to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">environmentVariable:IfFail:</span></code> as
if you had misspelled it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image18.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image18.png" style="width: 460.0px; height: 192.0px;" />
</div>
<p>Press the green button to accept the change, then hit the <em>Get it</em> button. This should break something!
In fact, instead of the result of the message, a Self debugger will materialize:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image19.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image19.png" style="width: 482.4px; height: 228.0px;" />
</div>
<p>The debugger has a label to indicate which process ran aground, a status indication shown in blue,
some buttons for controlling the process, and a collapsed outliner for the stack. Expand the stack:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id12">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image20.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image20.png" style="width: 431.2px; height: 202.4px;" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 6.1 </span><span class="caption-text">Expanded stack.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The stack filters out uninteresting frames by default <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f6" id="id6"><sup>6</sup></a>. The debugger assumes that the first method
you want to see is the one based on the text in the evaluator, and since the stack grows upwards this
oldest frame appears at the bottom. It has no method name, and contains the code <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code>. That
method called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code>, whose code is too long to show next to the slot button, and that method
called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evnironmentAt:IfFail:</span></code> because we just sabotaged it! Of course there is no such method,
but Self creates one dynamically to handle the error.</p>
<p>The little boxes represent the receiver and arguments of the methods on the stack. Get the receiver
of the evnironment... message. Click on the box to the left of the word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evnironmentVariable:</span></code>
(the one labelled “<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">...bals</span> <span class="pre">os</span></code>” if you are running on the Macintosh):</p>
<div class="figure" id="id14">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image21.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image21.png" style="width: 233.6px; height: 42.4px;" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 6.3 </span><span class="caption-text">Outliner with interface to the Macintosh.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This object represents the interface to the Macintosh operating system. The little button with the
apostrophe in the top-left-hand corner indicates that this object has a comment. Push the button to
show (or hide) the comment:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image22.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image22.png" />
</div>
<p>(To automatically resize the outliner to show all the text, press control-L.) To see one of Self’s
scroll bars, grab the comment’s resize triangle (with the left-button) and move it up a bit:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image23.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image23.png" />
</div>
<p>The affordance that appears on the right of the text is the scroll bar, and you can either drag on the
little black line or just click in the bar to scroll the text up or down.</p>
<p>Push the little apostrophe button again to hide the comment. Now, you could expand this object to
find the correct spelling of the “<em>evnironment...</em>” message. But instead, pretend that all you remember
is that it has the word “Variable” in it somewhere. So, use a facility called <em>Find Slot</em> that takes
a pattern and an object, and finds any matching slots in that object or its parents. Use the middlebutton
on the outliner’s title (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">macOSGlobals</span> <span class="pre">os</span></code>) to get the object menu and select <em>Find slot</em>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image24.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image24.png" />
</div>
<p>Double-click on the word “foo*” to select that field for editing. (The same trick works on slot
names)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image25.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image25.png" />
</div>
<p>Since we are searching for a method with “Variable” in its name, backspace (the delete key on the
Mac) three times <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f7" id="id7"><sup>7</sup></a> to erase the “foo” type in “*Variable*“, hit the green button, and then hit the
triangle to start the search (if you make a typing mistake, you can double click the text to make it
editable again). The triangle will blink a bit while it is searching (one could do other things in the
meantime during a long search), then the enumerator will show the match(es):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image26.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image26.png" />
</div>
<p>Clicking on the little square button(s) would show the exact method(s). But, for our purposes, just
knowing the name is enough and now you have to fix it. So back to the debugger and click on the
method button on the right in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code> slot to expand the stack frame for the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whoAmI</span></code> method:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image27.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image27.png" style="width: 441.6px; height: 275.2px;" />
</div>
<p>Now the debugger shows the source of the method, with the actual message being sent highlighted.
(In this case it is just the whole thing.) One of the conveniences in the Self programming environment
is that you do not have to go back to the original method to fix it, but can just fix it here (following
the grand tradition of Lisp and Smalltalk programming environments). So use the left
button to select the “vn” and type “nv” instead, then hit the green button to accept the change. The
green button will stay in a bit longer because when a method is changed from the debugger, every
slot pointing to that same method is made to feel the change—the method is changed in place (see
the figure below). This feature lets you change a method in a clone and simultaneously affect the</p>
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image28.png" class="align-center" id="figprototype" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image28.png" />
<p>prototype, if you are putting your methods in prototypes instead of traits. Changing a method in an
ordinary outliner would just affect that one object, even if other objects had been cloned from it.
This rule avoids unintentional changes. The more global kind of change performed by the debugger
takes a little longer. When it is accomplished, the red and green buttons will disappear:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image29.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image29.png" style="width: 428.8px; height: 231.2px;" />
</div>
<p>Now <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">os</span></code> is highlighted to show that the process is about to send “os” to implicit-self. Try the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Step</span></code>
button, which performs a single message send. After hitting the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Step</span></code> button twice (and a control-
L to widen the debugger), the process will have entered the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">environmentVariable:IfFail:</span></code> method:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image30.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image30.png" style="width: 446.4px; height: 304.0px;" />
</div>
<p>This method is not too interesting (especially on the Macintosh), so leave the debugger by hitting
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Continue</span></code> and letting the process finish.</p>
<p>Congratulations on making through the interactive tutorial. In the remainder of this manual, we
will dive deeper into the programming environment for readers who want to write real programs in
Self.</p>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">copy-down</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">module</span></code> enumerators will be covered later.</p>
<p>The other enumerators can be summoned from several places: the outliner menu, the slot menu,
and the text editor menu. As a shortcut, selecting a whole expression in the text editor and then asking
for an enumerator will bring up the enumerator to search for the outermost message send in the
expression. So if you select the following expression: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aSet</span></code> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findFirst:</span></code> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">elem</span> <span class="pre">IfPresent:</span></code>
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[snort]</span></code> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">IfAbsent:</span></code> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[sludge]</span></code> and choose implementors from the text editor menu, you will
get an Implementors enumerator ready to search for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findFirst:IfPresent:IfAbsent:</span></code>. Of
course, you can always change the search target by double-clicking and editing the text. The text
editors also implement a host of handy double-clicking shortcuts.</p>
<p>Finally there is one last detail about enumerations: many contain a check-box to choose <em>Wellknown
only</em>. This is always checked by default to speed things up. When checked, only wellknown
(i.e. filed-out, see below) objects are searched, which is much faster.</p>

<h2>6.4. The Transporter</h2>
<p>The transporter has been built in order to move programs from one world of objects to another. You can
ignore it as long as you work with just one snapshot. However, if you want to give your
program to someone else, or save it as source, or read it in to a newer snapshot, you will need to
learn about the transporter.</p>

<h3>6.4.1. The Traditional Schism between Program and Data</h3>
<p>What is a program? In most systems it is a piece of text, although in more advanced environments
it may have structure. It is a description that can be used to create an activity, a running program,
that can then operate on data. In the conventional view:</p>

</table>
<p>This model grew up in an era where computers were too small to host both compilers and applications
at the same time. Although it has some virtues it makes other operations very hard: it is hard
to include data, such as hand-drawn icons, directly into a program, and it is hard to write applications
whose data domain is really programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-program">
<h3>6.4.2. Data = Program</h3>
<p>For Self, we have gone a different way, following in the footsteps of Smalltalk and Lisp:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>A Self program consists of live objects.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Self has no edit/run mode. To change an object, you do not retreat to a source file, or even to a class,
you just change the object itself. This immediacy and concreteness lessens the cognitive burden on
the programmer, smooths the learning curve, and hastens gratification.</p>
<p>However, this stance creates a big problem the moment you need to move a program from one
world of objects to another; it is very hard to pin down what to do. For example, suppose an object
contains a slot with 1024 in it. Should that value be copied literally? Perhaps it is the result of some
computation (such as the width of the current screen) and should be recomputed instead. There
simply is not enough information in a Self object to extract programs from Snapshots.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changes-vs-pieces">
<h3>6.4.3. Changes vs. Pieces</h3>
<p>Earlier in the project we considered constructing a calculus of changes that could be used to represent
programs, and then moving programs by reapplying the changes to the new snapshot. But, we
had enough on our plate and rejected this approach as too ambitious to tackle without a dedicated
graduate student.</p>
<p>Instead, we decided to represent programs as pieces that could be filed out of a snapshot and filed
in to another. To allow us to merge changes to the same program, we decided to represent its pieces
as Unix source files amenable to RCS. The Self Transporter was built to save programs as source
files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects-vs-slots">
<h3>6.4.4. Objects vs. Slots</h3>
<p>But what is a program? Although a new program frequently involves creating new objects, it also
can mean added slots to existing objects. For example, a program to find palindromes might add a
slot to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">traits</span> <span class="pre">string</span></code> called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isPalindrome</span></code>. So we decided to refine the granularity of the
Transporter to the slot level; each slot has an annotation <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f8" id="id8"><sup>8</sup></a> (its module) which gives the name of the
source file containing that slot. This hair- or rather object-splitting implies that one object may be
built incrementally as the result of reading several files, and so the transporter endeavors to keep
the order that the files are read in as independent as possible. Since each object can possess slots
in different modules, the outliner shows a summary of the modules of an object, sorted by frequency.</p>
<p>Turned around, a module can be viewed as a collection of slots, plus some other information: each
module also includes a directory, a list of submodules to be read in whenever it is read, and
<em>postFileIn</em> method to be run whenever the module is read. These data allow modules to be organized
hierarchically by subsystem, for example the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">allUI2</span></code> module includes all the modules in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ui2</span></code>
system.</p>
<p>Now here comes the nice part: the Self environment incrementally maintains a mapping from modules
to slots, and a list of changed modules, which can be obtained from the background menu.
When you make a change the appropriate module will be added to the list, and can be written as a
source file by clicking its &#8216;<em>W</em>‘ button. The middle-button menu on the changed modules and individual
modules contains a host of useful entries for understanding what has been changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-save-for-the-contents-of-a-slot">
<h3>6.4.5. What to Save for the Contents of a Slot</h3>
<p>At this point, the reader may be thinking <em>“So modules know which slots they include, but how do
they know which objects to include?”</em> After all, when the transporter saves a slot in a file what can
it put for the contents of the slot? Here is where the transporter runs smack into the problem of not
enough information, and a variety of means have to be used. As shown in the flowchart below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image31.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image31.png" />
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sometimes the programmer does not want to store the actual contents of a slot, but instead
wants to store an initialization expression. This intention is captured with another annotation
on a slot: each slot can either be annotated <em>Follow Slot</em> or <em>Initialize To Expression</em>
In the latter case, an initializer is also supplied.</li>
<li>Even though the transporter is supposed to follow the slot, it may contain an object that is created
by another slot. For example, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parent</span></code> slot in a point should just refer to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">traits</span> <span class="pre">point</span></code>
rather than recreating the traits object. This information is captured by a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Creator</span></code> annotation
on each object that gives the path from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lobby</span></code> to the slot intended to create the object.
In this case, the transporter just files out a reference to the object’s creator, cleverly
enough so that the actual creator slot does not need to have been already filed in. On the other
hand, if an object is immutable, its identity is not important. If an object is annotated as
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isComplete</span></code> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f9" id="id9"><sup>9</sup></a> the transporter sends it <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isImmutableForFilingOut</span></code> and if that message returns
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></code>, the transporter never files out a reference. For example, integers would answer
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></code> to this message.</li>
<li>If the contents of the slot is a simple (usually immutable) object like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">17</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3&#64;4</span></code>, or ‘<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>’ (the
string) the transporter should just ask the object for a string to store. It does this by checking to
see if the object is annotated as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isComplete</span></code> to see if it is safe to send the object messages,
checks to see if this object is itself needed for the string (it would be a mistake to file out the
prototypical point as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0&#64;0</span></code>, because the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> slot would never be defined), then asks the object for a
store string.To see if the object must itself be filed out, it sends <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storeStringNeeds</span></code> and if
this message does not return the object itself it sends <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storeStringIfFail</span></code>:. If this succeeds,
the transporter can save a data-type specific string for the object. This fairly elaborate mechanism
allows programmers to add new kinds of objects that transport out with type-specific creation
strings.</li>
<li>Finally, if it can do nothing else, the transporter creates a new object for the contents of the
slot. The object is created in a clever way so that a file that adds slots to an object can be read
before the file that officially creates the object without loss of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Filing out objects is too complicated, and over the past two years we have repeatedly tried simpler
schemes. However, all of the capabilities in the current scheme seem to be essential in some case.
This issue remains as a question for future work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="copy-down">
<h3>6.4.6. Copy Down</h3>
<p>Because Self eschews classes and because the current compiler cannot optimize dynamic inheritance,
it is necessary to copy-down slots when refining an object. For example, the prototypical
morph object contains many slots that every morph should have, and some mechanism is needed
to ensure that their presence is propagated down to more specialized morphs like the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">circleMorph</span></code>.
In a class-based language, this need is met by a rule ensuring that subclasses include any instance
variables defined in their superclasses. In Self, this inheritance of structure is separated from the
inheritance of information performed by the normal hierarchy of parent slots. Instead of including
a facility for inheriting structure in the language, Self implements a facility in the environment,
called “copy-down.” An object’s annotation can contain a copy-down parent, copy-down selector,
and set of slots to omit. The copy-down parent is sent the message given by the copy-down selector,
and (except for the slots-to-omit), the slots in the result are added to the object. Copied-down
slots are shown in pink in the outliner. For example, here are the prototypical morph and the prototypical
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">circleMorph</span></code>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Pgm_Env_Image32.png" src="_images/Pgm_Env_Image32.png" style="width: 444.8px; height: 386.4px;" />
</div>
<p>The <em>Basic Morph State</em> category of slots has been copied from those in morph by first copying
the morph and removing all its submorphs (i.e. by sending it <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">copyRemoveAllMorphs</span></code>) and then
copying the resultant slots, omitting <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parent</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prototype</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rawBox</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rawColor</span></code>. The first
three of these slots were omitted because their contents had to be different; copied-down slots are
copied, they cannot be specially initialized in Self. The omitted slot <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rawBox</span></code> is more interesting;
circle morphs do not need this slot at all and so omit it. Most other object-oriented programming
systems would not allow a subclass to avoid inheriting an instance variable.</p>
<p>The Self programming environment uses the copy-down information to allow the programmer
to use a class-based style when appropriate. For example, if the programmer adds a slot to morph
the environment will offer to add it to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">circleMorph</span></code>, too. If the programmer should use a text editor
to edit the definition of morph, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">circleMorph</span></code> object will be changed after rereading both object’s
text files. The least convenient aspect of using copy-downs is that to do the moral equivalent
of creating a subclass, the programmer has to create two objects: a new traits object, and a new prototype,
and then set the object annotation of the new prototype. Perhaps someday there will be a
button to do this, or perhaps other styles of programming will emerge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trees">
<h3>6.4.7. Trees</h3>
<p>By default, the tranporter writes out Self modules out to a tree rooted in the current working directory, or the &#8216;objects&#8217; subdirectory of the directory given to the VM in the shell environment variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELFWORKING_DIR</span></code>.</p>
<p>Howevever Self modules have a slot &#8216;tree&#8217; which can take a name of a tree. If the name of the tree is not an empty string, then the module writer will look up a directory in the dictionary found at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">modules</span> <span class="pre">init</span> <span class="pre">treeDictionary</span></code>.</p>
<p>This allows the developer to maintain several separate trees. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">modules</span> <span class="n">init</span>
  <span class="n">registerTree</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;org_selflanguage_webserver&#39;</span>
            <span class="n">At</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;path/to/parent-folder&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span>

<span class="n">bootstrap</span> <span class="n">read</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;webserver&#39;</span>
        <span class="n">InTree</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;org_selflanguage_webserver&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Important considerations: module names are globally unique (that is, two modules called &#8216;webserver&#8217; in different trees are considered the same module and will overwrite each other). The tree name itself should also be globally unique - that is it is not possible to have two trees with the same name in a single Self world.</p>
<p>The advantages of this over a simple symbolic link to a separate filesystem tree is we can do overlays - if you want special string behaviour, then put it in your tree in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_tree/core/string.self</span></code> and it will override as expected.</p>
<p>Modules that import subparts will import them from the same tree by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="versioning">
<h3>6.4.8. Versioning</h3>
<p>Each transporter module has a slot named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">revision</span></code> containing a string version number. It is recommended that you use Semantic Versioning <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f10" id="id10"><sup>10</sup></a> so that the version of a module can be tested as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">modules</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">modules</span> <span class="n">init</span> <span class="n">moduleVersion</span> <span class="n">copyOn</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;1.0.0&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">ifFalse</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">log</span> <span class="n">warning</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Old string version&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This test could be placed in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preFileIn</span></code> slot of your module to ensure a sane file in environment before the rest of the file is read.</p>
<p>This concludes a brief tour of the Self programming environment. Although we strove for simplicity
in the design of Self, its programming environment includes a fair amount of functionality
which may take a while to learn. We hope that you find the investment worth the reward.</p>

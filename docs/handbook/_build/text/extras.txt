Extras
******

   Last updated 4 February 2014 for Self 4.5.0

The default Self source code tree comes with a number of extra objects
and features which aren't included in the default Self World. These
can in general be loaded by doing:

   'path/to/file.self' runScript

or:

   bootstrap load: 'file' From: 'path/to'

where the current working directory is the *objects* directory of the
source code tree.

These extra features include:

* The Original Self UI

  * X11 with 256 Colors

  * VM with X11 support

  * Preparing a snapshot

  * Starting the UI

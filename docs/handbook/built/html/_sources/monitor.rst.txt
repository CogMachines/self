The system monitor
==================

The Self system contains a system monitor to display information about the internal workings of
the system such as memory management and compilation. It is invoked with ``_Spy:`` ``true`` (there
is are shortcuts in the shell, ``spyOn`` and ``spyOff``). When it is active, the system monitor takes over
a portion of your screen with a window that looks like this:

..  figure:: images/Chapter_5_Figure_7.*

The indicators in the left part of the display correspond to various internal activities and events. On
the very left are the CPU bars which show how much CPU is used in various parts of the system.
The following table lists the individual indicators:

.. tabularcolumns:: p{5cm} p{10cm}
.. table:: The system monitor display: indicators

  ===============   ====================================================================================================
  CPU               Bar What It Means
  ===============   ====================================================================================================
  VM                CPU time spent executing in the VM, i.e. for primitives, garbage collection etc.
  Lkup              CPU time used by compile-time and run-time lookups.
  Comp              CPU time spent by the Self compilers. The black part stands for time consumed by the non-inling
                    compiler (NIC), the gray part for the simple inlining compiler (SIC).
  Self              CPU time spent executing compiled Self code. The black part stands for time consumed by
                    unoptimized (NIC) code, the gray part for optimized (SIC) code.
  CPU               This bar displays the percentage of the CPU that the Self process is getting (a completely filled
                    bar equals 100% CPU utilization by Self). Black stands for user time, gray for system time.
  Dot               Below the CPU bar is a small dot which moves whenever a process switch takes place.

  X-compiling Y    The X compiler (where X is either “nic” or “sic”) is compiling the method named Y into machine
                   code.
  scavenge         The Self object memory is being scavenged. A scavenge is a fast, partial garbage collection (see
                   :ref:`[Ung84] <citations>` , :ref:`[Ung86] <citations>` , :ref:`[Lee88] <citations>` ).
  GC               The Self object memory is being fully garbage-collected.
  flushing         Self is flushing the code cache.
  compacting       Self is compacting the code cache.
  reclaiming       Self is reclaiming space in the code cache to make room for a new method.
  sec reclaim      Self is flushing some methods in the code cache because there is not enough room in one of the
                   secondary caches (the caches holding the debugging and dependency information).
  ic flush         Self is flushing all inline caches.
  LRU sweep        Self is examining methods in the code cache to determine whether they have been used recently.
  page N N         page faults occurred during the last time interval (N is not displayed if N=1). The time interval
                   currently is 1/25 of a second.
  read             Self is blocked reading from a “slow” device, e.g., the keyboard or mouse.
  write            Self is blocked writing to a “slow” device, e.g., the screen.
  disk in/out      Self is doing disk I/O.
  UNIX             Self is blocked in some UNIX system call other than read or write.
  idle             Self has nothing to do. (shows up only when using processes.)
  ===============  ===================================================================================================

The middle part of the display contains some information on VM memory usage displayed in textual
form, as described below:


.. tabularcolumns:: p{5cm} p{10cm}
.. table:: VM memory status information

  ===============  ===================================================================================================
  Name             Description
  ===============  ===================================================================================================
  RSRC             Size and utilization of the resource area (an area of memory used for temporary storage by the
                   compiler and by primitives).
  C-Heap           Number of bytes allocated on the C heap by Self (excluding the memory and code spaces and the
                   resource area).
  ===============  ===================================================================================================

The memory status portion of the system monitor consists of bars representing memory spaces and
their utilization; all bars are drawn to scale relative to one another, their areas being proportional
to the actual sizes of the memory spaces. The next table explains the details of this part of the system
monitor’s display.


.. tabularcolumns:: p{5cm} p{10cm}
.. table:: The system monitor display: memory status

  ===============  =============================================================================================================
  Space            Description
  ===============  =============================================================================================================
  object memory    The four (or more) bars represent (from top to bottom) eden, the two survivor spaces, and subsequent
                   bars are segments of old space. The left and right parts of each bar represent the space used
                   by “plain” objects and byte vectors, respectively. The above picture shows a situation in which
                   about half of old space is filled with plain objects and about 25% is filled with byte vectors. A fraction
                   of old space’s used portions is currently paged out (gray areas).
                   Below the old space is a ruler, marked in 1Mb intervals, showing the total allocated in old space
                   (extending line at the left). To the right is a red bar representing how much of old space is reserved
                   for use by the Virtual Machine, and a yellow bar representing the low space threshold (when
                   crossed, the scheduler is notified and a garbage colelction may take place).
  code cache       These four bars represent the cache holding compiled methods with their associated debugging and
                   dependency information. The bar labelled ‘code’ represents the cache containing the actual
                   machine code for methods (including some headers and relocation information); it is divided into
                   code generated by the primary (non-inlining) compiler, or NIC, and code generated by the
                   secondary, smarter compiler (SIC). The cache represented by the bar labelled ‘deps’ contains
                   dependency information for the compiled methods, and the cache represented by the bar labelled
                   ‘debug’ contains the debugging information. The three-way split reduces the working set size of the
                   code cache. The cache represented by the bar labelled ‘PICs’ contains polymorphic inline caches.
